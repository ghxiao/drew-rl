Dear Thomas and Stijn,

The following is the comparation of 
query answering
DReW and dlvhex+dlplugin on LUBM ontology

Query	DReW	dlvhex+dlplugin
	ms	ms
0	1188 	4307 
1	931 	3514 
2	899 	3877 
3	1028 	4043 
4	878 	3508 

1. some of the queries are from TK's master thesis and others are modified from LUBM query benchmark.

for example, query 1 is 
f (X, Y) :- DL[Faculty](X), DL[Faculty](Y), D1 = D2 , U1 != U2 ,
			DL[doctoralDegreeFrom](X, U1), DL[worksFor](X, D1 ),
            DL[doctoralDegreeFrom](Y, U2), DL[worksFor](Y, D2 ).

2. Not all the results return by DReW and dlvhex are the same. I am checking the details now. 

3. All the dl atoms are of the form "DL[;Q](X,Y)". I do not have complex dl-program bechmark now.

4. Usually, DReW spent 1/4 of the time of dlvhex

Best,
